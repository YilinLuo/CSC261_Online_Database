Public_html:
This Public_html folder contains all the UI components and basic PHP functions of the webpage. 'UI.php' is the home page to navigate users to 'Departments.php','form.php','List_Of_Tasks.php', 'Projects.php' and back. All webpages are connected by an interactive index section, allowing user to jump around. All data on the webpages are directly extracted from MySQL database. 'form.php' and 'update.php' both participate in changing MySQL through forms. 'form.php' presents the table of EMPLOYEE where each tuple is an input field with a submit type ('upgrade'), allowing user to conveniently change and update the tuple values.
